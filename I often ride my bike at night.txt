Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed by my life that I need to ride my bike, drink some beer and think about the shitty world I have to deal with.
I always follow the moon and it never dissapoints me. Sometimes it gives me surprises.
Could be some dogs guarding a lot for a piece of meat, or a nice spot to stop by and take some pictures of that special moment. Running away from dogs though is a bit more special.
Most of the times I end up riding along the oiled-shitty waters of piraeus. Admiring the different air. Then I get to my first job and remember the fact that there's always worse.
The truth is I keep visiting piraeus so this story has no end yet. I keep writing history on the moonlight-lit roads with my bike and now my car.
Different love, different air, same bullshit.
